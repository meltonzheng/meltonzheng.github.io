## What I learned after 365 days of revewing Anki cards

As a med student, I needed to know a bunch of random ass things like the different cofactors that are involved in the citric acid cycle. As a result, I had to develop a learning system able to capture high volume of data, or at least take advantage of one availabe. Therefore, I used Anki. Here are the lessons I learned after studying hundreds (>1,264 hrs) of Anki cards.

1. You know less than you think you know.
2. Take advantage of stability of a card
3. Use any resource/tip/trick to your advantage
